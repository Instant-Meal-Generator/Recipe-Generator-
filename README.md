# Recipe-Generator-

When the user click on a button, it gives a random generated receipt

Created by David Stokes, and Cedric Vallieu.

This is for those dealing with the pandemic and who want to spice up their at-home food choices, or those who just have trouble making up their mind for their meal of the day. The user will be able to click on a button to generate a random recipe of their choice from a click of a button. We will incorporate local storage so that the user can come back to the recipe of their choice, The recipes that we use will come from an API, and as a stretch goal we intend to add functionality to add elements that let you choose a drink and dessert along. Images will also be added to show the final product.

MVP: Create a clickable website for a random recipe generator.
